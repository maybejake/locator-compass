# Locator Compass

Want your experience bar back? Locator Compass disables the locator bar for all players by default! Holding a compass in your mainhand or offhand will make it appear while you're holding it!

Want to hide from the locator bar altogether? Check out [Locator Vanish](https://github.com/maybejake/locator-vanish)!
